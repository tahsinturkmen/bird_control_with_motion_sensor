# bird_control_with_motion_sensor.
Values in the range of (+65 -65) were read from the lis302dl motion sensor in the STM32f4 microcontroller from the x and y axes with SPI communication. With UART communication, these values were moved along the x and y axes of the bird figure prepared with PYGAME.
